Assignment for [part 5](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5/login_in_frontend)
 of the course Full Stack Open.
In this part, the front-end part of the application is implemented. I also added a backend similar to the one in part 4 for convenience.

To run the application, you need to run the server and client in separate terminals

### To start the server:
1. git clone
2. cd blog-list-backend
3. npm install
4. npm start

### To start the client:
1. git clone
2. cd bloglist-frontend
3. npm install
4. npm start
